Rohlik Group is a leading European e-grocery innovator, trying to revolutionize the food retail industry. They operate across 11 warehouses in Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Romania.

The challenge is to predict the number of grocery delivery orders at selected warehouses for the upcoming months. In this dataset, I used Support Vector Regression (SVR) to forecast the orders based on available attributes. However, other factors like precipitation and snow could significantly impact the orders. Unfortunately, we don't have data for these factors for future days and months.

Some of the visualizations for a better understanding of the data and its characteristics.
